/**
 * The base class of all operator translators.
 *
 * All operators are associated to a CompilationContext. The compilation context serves as a central
 * context object containing the query state, all operator translators, all expression translators
 * and all pipeline objects. Upon construction, it is the translators duty to prepare each of its
 * children in the provided compilation context.
 *
 * Operators must also register themselves in the pipelines. If an operator belongs to multiple
 * pipelines, it may construct new pipelines and register its children as appropriate between the
 * one or more pipelines it controls.
 *
 * State:
 * ------
 * Operators usually require some runtime state in order to implement their logic. A hash-join
 * requires a hash table, a sort requires a sorting instance, a block-nested loop join requires a
 * temporary buffer, etc. State exists at two levels: query and pipeline.
 *
 * Query-level state exists for the duration of the entire query. Operators declare and register
 * their state entries with the QueryState object in CompilationContext, initialize their state in
 * InitializeQueryState(), and destroy their state in TearDownQueryState(). All query-state based
 * operations are called exactly once per operator in the plan. Translators may not assume an
 * initialization order.
 *
 * Pipeline-level state exists only within a pipeline. Operators declare and register pipeline-local
 * state in DeclarePipelineState(), initialize it in InitializePipelineState(), and destroy in in
 * TearDownPipelineState(). Since some operators participate in multiple pipelines, a context object
 * is provided to discern <b>which pipeline</b> is being considered.
 *
 * Data-flow:
 * ----------
 * Operators participate in one or more pipelines. A pipeline represents a uni-directional data flow
 * of tuples or tuple batches. Another of way of thinking of pipelines are as a post-order walk of
 * a subtree in the query plan composing of operators that do not materialize tuple (batch) data
 * into cache or memory.
 *
 * All pipelines have a source operator and a sink operator. Tuples (batches) flow from the source
 * to the sink along a pipeline in a WorkContext. When an operator receives a work context, it is
 * a request to generate the logic of the operator (i.e., perform some work). When this work is
 * complete, it should be sent to the following operator in the pipeline.
 *
 * Operators may generate pre-work and post-work pipeline logic by overriding BeginPipelineWork()
 * and FinishPipelineWork() which are called before and after the primary/main pipeline work is
 * generated, respectively.
 *
 * Helper functions:
 * -----------------
 * Operators may require the use of helper functions or auxiliary structures in order to simplify
 * their logic. Helper functions and structures should be defined in both DefineHelperStructs() and
 * DefineHelperFunctions(), respectively. All helper structures and functions are visible across the
 * whole query and must be declared in the provided input container.
