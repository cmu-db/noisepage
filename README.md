## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Is this Carnegie Mellon's new database system project that is replacing [Peloton](https://github.com/cmu-db/peloton)?**

   Yes.
   
2. **Is the new name of the DBMS "terrier"?**

   No. We have not announced the new name yet but it will not be "terrier". That is the name of [Andy's dog](http://home.bt.com/news/animals/baffled-jack-russell-gets-the-wrong-end-of-the-stick-as-it-tries-to-squeeze-through-dog-flap-11363989001132).
   
3. **When will you announce the new system?**

   We hope to have our first release in 2020.

4. **Will the new system still be "[self-driving](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2018/04/what-is-a-self-driving-database-management-system.html)"?**

   Yes, our goal is to have this new system to support autonomous operation and optimization as a first-class design principle.

5. **Will the new system still be PostgreSQL compatiable?**
   
   Yes. The DBMS supports the PostgresSQL network protocol (both simple and extended) and emulates PostgresSQL's catalog layout. We are working on support for PL/pgSQL UDFs.

6. **How can I get involved?**
   
   See the [New Student Guide](https://github.com/cmu-db/terrier/wiki/New-Student-Guide). If you are a current student at CMU, then you should consider enrolling in one of the [database courses](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/courses/). Non-CMU students are also welcome to contribute.
