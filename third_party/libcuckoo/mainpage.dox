/*! \mainpage libcuckoo Documentation
 *
 *  libcuckoo is a high-performance, memory efficient hash table that
 *  supports concurrent reads and writes.
 *
 *  \ref cuckoohash_map is the class of the hash table. Its interface
 *  resembles that of STL's unordered_map but does contain some
 *  important differences.
 *
 *  Internally, the hash table is partitioned into an array of
 *  buckets, each of which contains \c SLOT_PER_BUCKET slots to
 *  store items.
 *
 *  Each bucket has a lock to ensure multiple threads don't modify the
 *  same elements. Most operations will lock no more than two buckets
 *  at a time, thereby allowing for concurrent reads and writes.
