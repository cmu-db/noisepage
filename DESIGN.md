#  Project Design Document: Concurrent Schema Change

## Overview

Each table in a DBMS has a schema, which specifies how many columns are in the table, and the constrains on each column (type, nullable, default value). A schema change can involving adding/dropping columns, or updating column constraints. Many DBMSs (PostgreSQL, SQLite, and RocksDB) block the table when they perform a schema change on a table. This causes the table to be unavailable for a considerable duration, which is undesirable for systems requiring high availability. Terrier currently does not support schema change. 

The goal of this project is to add schema change functionality to Terrier, and do it in a non-blocking, lazy way. The idea is to store a separate Datatable for each schema version, and do it Our goals are:

75%: Support lazy add/drop column and arbitrary number of schema versions      (mostly done, need to update the upper level of the system and the catalog, and pass benchmarks)

100%: Do background migration of tupleslots. Support GC of old schema versions and datatables. 

125%: Support unsafe schema changes, which includes updating type, nullable, or default value status of columns.

150%: Codegen layer to precompile tuple transformations.

We have yet to design our system for unsafe schema changes and precompilation. In this design doc we will focus on the 75% and 100% goals.

## Scope

Our project will mainly modify Sqltable and Catalog. Sqltable will be modified to handle multiple datatables . The datatables are transparent to the users of Sqltable,  who view Sqltable as a logical table with multiple versions. All functions in the Sqltable API (such as insert/delete/update/select/scan/begin/end/projectmapforoids) are augmented with an extra argument, layout_version. layout_version tells Sqltable which version of the table the function is targeted to.

We will modify the Catalog to support the functions DatabaseCatalog::UpdateSchema()/GetSchema()/GetConstraints(). The catalog will be store information about the schema versions of each Sqltable, and use the timestamp of a transaction to infer the correct schema version of each Sqltable the transaction accesses. 

We will not change the API of Datatable, and make only minor additions to it. For convenience, within each Datatable we store its corresponding version, default value map, column id to oid map, and column oid to id map (explained below). Similarly, we will not be touching Tupleslots, Rawblocks, or Index.

We will also make minor changes to upper levels of Terrier, such the execution layer (e.g. storage_interface.cpp). 

## Architectural Design

To manage multiple datatables, each Sqltable keeps a ordered map (tables_) from version number to a struct containing the metadata of each datatable (called DataTableVersion). 

Note that in the vast majority of cases, there will be no schema changes, and each Sqltable manages only one Datatable. If we need to go through tables_, which is a concurrent map (or vector), on each call to Sqltable, that will be a huge overhead. Therefore, we will cache the DataTable in the SqlTable when there is only one DataTable to bypass the map/vector lookup.

Each Sqltable has a separate version number counter, managed by the catalog. Each Sqltable starts out with version number 0, and manages a single datatable. When UpdateSchema() is called, the version number is incremented, and we create a new datatable via SqlTable::CreateTable(), which is the intended location for all tuples under the new schema. Note that within a Sqltable, each datatable uniquely corresponds to a version number and a schema, both of which never change. Therefore, in each datatable, we store its version number.  Moreover, for each datatable within Sqltable,  we store in DataTableVersion its schema, a default value map, and two maps from column oid to id and from id to oid.

To do an SQL query such as updating a tuple, a transaction first uses the index on Sqltable to find the tupleslot of the tuple (note that when we update the index when migrating tupeslots). We can get the raw block from the top 44 bits of the tupleslot, and the raw block has reference to the datatable of the tupleslot.   Thus we know the version number of the datatable the tuple is current stored in, call this the *storage_version*.

Each SQL query also comes with an argument, version_number, which is the schema version of the Sqltable that should be seen by the current transaction. Let us call these versions *intended_version*. 

To migrate a tuple with primary key *K* from an older datatable to a newer datatable, we first logically delete the tuple from the older datatable with the current transaction's timestamp, then insert the tuple to the newer datatable. Note that the old tupleslot for *K* has been deleted and a new tupleslot was created. We will update the index by logically deleting *K* then inserting *K* with the new tupleslot.

Note that *storage_version* might be smaller than *intended_version*, which occurs if a transaction accesses a tuple of a newer schema version, but the tuple has not yet been migrated over from old datatables. Different Sqltable operations deal with this special case of  *storage_version < intended_version* differently, as we will  describe below.

#### Sqltable::insert 

There is no *storage_version* in this case. We directly insert to the table corresponding to *intended_version*.

#### Sqltable::delete

Whether *storage_version < intended_version* or *storage_version = intended_version*, we always logically delete the tuple from the datatable it is currently stored in.

#### Sqltable::update

If *storage_version < intended_version* we will read the tuple from the old datatable, do tuple transformation to new schema and update the tuple, then logically delete it from the old datatable  (corresponding to 
*storage_version*) and then insert it to the new datatable (corresponding to *intended_version*).  We will return the old tupleslot and the new tupleslot to the execution layer, which will update the index as described above.

#### Sqltable::select

Since we don't do migration on reads for now, we will not migrate tuples even in the case of *storage_version < intended_version*. We will read the tuple, transform it to the new schema, select its columns and return.

#### Sqltable::scan

Note that each tuple might physically exist in multiple datatables under a single Sqltable. However, for each transaction, only one copy of each tuple is visible across all datatables (we guarantee this by always logically deleting a tuple before migration).

Therefore, scan works by scanning all datatables in order. Recall that tables_ is an ordered map, so we can simply scan from tables_.begin() to tables_.end(). We will scan each datatable fully, can jump to the next datatable when we reach the end. It is possible that we need to revise the order to scan from tables_.end() to tables_.begin(), because in the special case that a single transaction interleaves scanning with updating, we might scan the same tuple twice (it is first scanned, then migrated to the end of tables_, then scanned again).

#### Default Values

Default values of columns are abstract expressions that can be evaluated. Since the schema of each datatable is fixed, for each datatablewe store a map in its DatatableVersion struct specifying the default values of all columns in its schema. The map is from column id to abstract expression. We can use this map for tuple transformation.

#### Tuple Transformation

We need to translate column_ids in the storage version to column_ids of the intended version. For any column present in the storage version but not present in the intended version we set the column_id to IGNORE_COLUMN_ID, and within DataTable we will skip over any columns with IGNORE_COLUMN_ID . For any column present in the intended version but not present in the storage version, we fill in default values for columns that were not present in the storage version.

## Design Rationale

#### Map or vector of datatables? 

Within Sqltable, we can either use a ordered concurrent map of version number to datatable, or use a vector of datatables (index i of vector corresponds to datatable with version number i) augmented with locks.  We conjecture that using a vector will be faster than a map. One potential problem with vectors is how to make it work with GC of old versions, and recovery. One potential problem with using Terrier's concurrent_map.h, which is a wrapper around tbb_concurrent_unordered_map, is that it is unordered (we need order for scan) and unsafe for concurrent deletes (useful for GC of old versions).

For now we are just using a std::map for single-threaded implementation, and we will revisit this decision later.

#### When to perform background migration and GC of old versions?

When we are sure that no transactions will ever access the schema version represented by an old datatable(inferring from low_watermark of transaction timestamps), we can safely GC the outdated datatable. However, since we do lazy migration, if most tuples in a datatable is not updated after a schema change, they will still be in the outdated datatable, and we can read and access them from the outdated datatable. In this case, it might be quite expensive to GC the outdated datatable, since we need to first migrate all its tuples to newer datatables. It seems that doing background migrations conservatively is good for read-heavy workloads, and doing background migrations aggresively might be good for update-heavy workloads interleaved with schema changes.  

Our current decision is to use a threshold to decide whether to do background migration: once the amount of tuples in an outdated datatable drops below the threshold, we start a background thread to migrate its tuples and GC the datatable when we're done.

#### Should we do migration on reads?

This is related to the above decision on GC. Currently, we only migrate tuples on Sqltable::update, if the tuple belongs to a newer datatable. Another policy is to also do migration on reads: after reading a tuple that belongs to a newer datatable (in Sqltable::select or Sqltable::scan), we migrate it to the new datatable before reading it. The benefit of migration on reads is: if we read a tuple from an outdated table multiple times,  transforming the tuple to its newest schema every time can be costly. With migration on reads, we need to do tuple transformation only once. Migration on reads  works well with aggresive migration. However, migration on reads might need to take write locks to do the migration, which can considerably slow down throughput of reads.

Our current decision is to not do migration on reads, since it might affect throughput. We will revisit this decision when we finish implementing GC and start benchmarking throughput.

## Testing Plan

First, we will write single-threaded unit tests in sql_table_test.cpp that tests schema changes. Currently, we wrote the testing framework, and have a test that tests inserting and a test that updates the schema by adding a single column. We will add more unit tests that add and drop multiple columns for multiple rounds. We will test that Sqltable::insert/delete/select/update/scan still works properly, after our change.

We will also write benchmarks that concurrently performs schema updates with normal Sqltable queries. This is mainly to test the correctness of our approach in the multi-threaded case, and can test the correctness of our changes to the catalog and storage layer. We will also use benchmarks with different workloads (read-heavy, update-heavy, eg.) to test the performance under schema changes.

Finally, as a stretch goal, we can integrate the Pantha Rei Schema Evolution Benchmark, which contains over 4.5 years of schema changes in Wikipedia’s history, and use this real world benchmark to test the throughput and memory usage of our non-blocking schema change implementation.

## Trade-offs and Potential Problems

One potential problem is we are unsure how adding versions and multiple datatables will influence logging and recovery. We will revisit this later when we finish the 100% goal.

## Future Work

One optimization is to precompile the tuple transformations. The code for different tuple transformations are mostly similar, except that the types of columns are different. Therefore, we can add code to the codegen layer to precompile the tuple transformation logic for different column types. This may speed up tuple transformations.
